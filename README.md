Very much a work in progress, this is an exploration of how React and ES6 can be used to create performant SVG animation and interactivity. Micro-Emitter is used for communication among components in lieu of Flux (as the goal is light exploration with no back end to speak of).

The index.js file contains a list of outstanding TODO items, including many of the elements that make a game actually enjoyable. However, even in the earliest stages this is a decent proof-of-concept for React as a framework for an interactive SVG application.
